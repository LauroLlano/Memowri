# Memowri
_A web app where you can create and organize your own notes._

_**Memowri** is a web application which allows you to create your own notes, organize them in different categories you create, and allows customization._

_This page has been made for learning and personal purposes._

## About project üóí
_As in its actual state, this app has only front-end functionality. However, I'll be updating the project as progress is made._

_I'm intending to implement database and back-end functionality for a fully functional application._

### Installing project üîß
_Once you download the files, you can open them directly in your browser, or you can put the folder in a local server._

_If you want to edit and play with the code, you'll be needing a text editor for that. You can use pretty much anything; even good ol' notepad._

* If you're using the **Live Server Extension** in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it may crash on submits. 

### Technologies used ‚å®Ô∏è

* _**Bootstrap 5.1**_ - Used in front-end design
* _**Vanilla javascript**_ - Used for validating fields and managing submits
