## About project üóí
As in its actual state, this app has only front-end functionality. However, I'll be updating the project as progress is made.

I'm intending to implement database and back-end functionality for a fully functional application.

### Installing project üîß
Once you download the files, you can open them directly in your browser, or you can put the folder in a local server.

If you want to edit and play with the code, you'll be needing a text editor for that. You can use pretty much anything; even good ol' notepad.

* _If you're using the **Live Server Extension** in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it may crash on submits._ 

### Technologies used ‚å®Ô∏è

* ***Bootstrap 5.1*** - Used in front-end design
* ***Vanilla javascript*** - Used for validating fields and managing submits
